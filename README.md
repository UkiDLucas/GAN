# Generative Adverserial Networks (GAN)

## Motivation

In this study, I attempt to understand, explain and implement the Generative Adverserial Networks (GAN).

## Explanation

The life on Earth is defined by competition of organisms. At any place and time, there is a set of conditions that represent a present "state-of-the-art". 

There are the nimblest of the antelopes, the top predators, the best of the of the camouflage and the smartest of the bunch, these are the current incumbents. 

And then, there are challengers, the newcommers that are slightly different hoping to gain this extra edge to win in the never ending race.



## To follow up

"In May 2019, researchers at Samsung demonstrated a GAN-based system that produces videos of a person speaking, given only a single photo of that person"
